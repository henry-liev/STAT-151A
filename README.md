# UC Berkeley STAT 151A Fall 2025 Notes
### Henry Liev

Lecture notes from UC Berkeley's STAT 151a in the Fall of 2025 taught by Professor Sam Pimental. 

Lectures 11, 23, and 35 were review sessions for Quizzes 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

On the dimensionality of design matrices: You may often see $\mathbb X \in \mathbb R^{n \times p}$, in this case, the intercept column si counted in $p$, the notes use $\mathbb X \in \mathbb R^{n \times (p+1)}$ for $p$ regressors and $+1$ intercept column.
